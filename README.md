Tasks:

Product Definition (MM01):

Define a finished good named "Bike."
Set language maintenance for Turkish and English.
Assign storage location Z001.
Planning strategy group: 40 (MÄ°P3 screen).
Set a safety stock of 10 for finished goods.
Define three semi-finished goods (Frame assembly, Wheel, and Frame).
Bill of Materials (CS01):

Create BOMs for Bike, Frame assembly, Wheel, and Frame.
Utilize existing SAP Material Numbers and Material Definitions for raw materials.
BOM Correction (CS02):

Identify and correct BOM mistake related to Frame assembly.
Routing Definition (CA01):

Define routing for Bike, Frame assembly, Wheel, and Frame using workcenters Z_PKT and Z_MNT.

Verify the creation of planned orders for the Bike and semi-finished goods using MD04.
Set MRP parameters as NETCH-1-3-1-3-1.
Planned Order Conversion (MD04):

Convert planned order releases of the Bike and semi-finished goods to production orders.
Production Order Completion (CO11N):

Assume completion of production for bikes and semi-finished goods.
Use CO11N to complete production orders, starting from semi-finished goods.
Stock Verification (MMBE, MB52):

Verify the stock of bikes in storage location Z001.
Check stock using MMBE and MB52.
Export the table from MB52 to an Excel file for record-keeping.
